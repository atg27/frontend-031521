This Project is used to track Authors and Publications. This project has an index page which renders links to individual authors and shows their name and publications. This app also has Create, Read, Update and Delete functionality. 

This App uses Rack, Ruby and Active Record in order to create a bakend API that is used in a React frontend. 

In order to start up the backend, cd into the backend and use "shotgun --port=9292" in the terminal.
